# Advent of Code 2020

This contains my solutions to some (probably not all) of the challenges in the Advent of Code 2020.

It is written in TypeScript... because I can!

### What is the Advent of Code?

Created by [Eric Wastl](https://github.com/topaz), the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2020) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.

You don't need a computer science background to participate - just a little programming knowledge and some problem solving skills will get you pretty far. Nor do you need a fancy computer; every problem has a solution that completes in at most 15 seconds on ten-year-old hardware.

### Usage

Install dependencies

```
npm i
```

Every challenge of every day (if they've been written) can be executed using the following format

```
npm run d$c%
```

Where `$` is the number of the day (1-31) and `%` is the challenge number (1-2)
